This repository contains code created at HO3 ([Hack Omaha III: Hack with a Vengeance](http://www.meetup.com/Open-Nebraska-Meetup/events/149197282/)).

We have plans beyond what works now, such as removing a dependency on a third party database and adding reviews from various social sites. Work in progress. Feel free to check out [our prototype](http://foodinspections.opennebraska.io).
