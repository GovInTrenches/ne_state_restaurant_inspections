Nebraska Food Inspections
=========================

This repository contains the Nebraska Food Inspections project initially created at HO3 ([Hack Omaha III: Hack with a Vengeance](http://www.meetup.com/Open-Nebraska-Meetup/events/149197282/)).

This project, formerly located at [rnelson/ne_state_restaurant_inspections](https://github.com/rnelson/ne_state_restaurant_inspections), 
uses some data from the NE Deptartment of Agriculture. We will soon be creating a new project (based on this one) that is Lancaster-speciic, as the [Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department](http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/health/) has agreed to work with us, providing far better data to create a more useful product. This one will remain here as an archive, but future work on it is unlikely.
